Summary

I combine the PISA 2012 data with GDP to explore the correlation between family possession and scores, and how GDP per capita affect the correlation.

Design

PISA collects information how many car, cellphone, TV, computer and bathroom students have. For each country, I make a box plot of score for every factor. They show some interesting correlation. The increasing possession of some factors helps students' scores while some hurts. Countries are categorized by their GDP per capita and the type of correlations are summarized in a multiple line chart. Finally, an interactive map is presented for user to explore.

Feedback

I got three comments.
1. There was a bug in the first page. If one clicks to the "technical detail" page and comes back, the page didn't load correctly;
2. Add navigation to every page;
3. Use a prettier font.
I've improved the page accordingly. Checkout the oldest commits to see the initial version.
